<h1> Anomaly Detection </h1>
<p> The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset was created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours. The tcpdump tool was utilised to capture 100 GB of the raw traffic (e.g., Pcap files). </p> 

<p> This dataset has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus, Bro-IDS tools are used and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label. These features are described in UNSW-NB15_features.csv file.</p>
